# **GainVintage**

GainVintage is a precision-crafted analog-style saturation and tone-shaping plugin designed to bring the character of iconic vintage gear into your digital workflow.

Key Features:

**Mode Selector (TUBE / TAPE)**: Switch between creamy tube saturation and tape-style compression and soft clipping.

**Input Gain & Output Trim**: Shape your signal with analog-style headroom and gain-staging control.

**Harmonic Drive**: Add subtle to aggressive saturation, with harmonics modeled after real analog circuitry.
